- Always remember to run `npm update` to ensure you're using the latest npm version for your projects.

- whenever you run `npm run dev` for the first time, a `dist` folder is generated. This folder contains the transpiled code from TS to JS.

- the `dist` folder should be the folder to be deployed during production

- ensure you check the `package.json` file for certainty of the files pre-installed.
